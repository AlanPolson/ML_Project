As far as possible, lets try to connect data *restfully*, to aid reproducability.

The code to read the data directly from the source can be seen [here](../Code/Restful_Data_Read.ipynb).

It downloads the data locally, in this folder.

The .gitignore file instructs git not to track any changes in this folder, so we all have the same path in our notebooks and we can 'git add --all' without worry.
